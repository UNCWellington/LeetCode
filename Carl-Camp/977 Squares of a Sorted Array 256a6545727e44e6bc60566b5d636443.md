## Description

     

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return *an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

## Solution

1. Algo#1

Idea

```
Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?

That means square then sort isn't accepted, Time: O(n+ nlg(n)) should be O(lg(n))

for negative array, the max should be left or right side
for positive array, the max must be in the right side.
Then we define 2 ptrs, left and right.
And define a new array res[], let k point to right sided, because we will get max value from l, r firstly

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
```

Process:

Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * len(nums)
        l, r,k = 0, len(nums)-1, len(nums) - 1
        
        while l <= r:  # we should use <= instead of < because, only 1 elem, or rest elem is l,r
            if nums[l] * nums[l] <= nums[r]* nums[r]:
                res[k] = nums[r] * nums[r]
                r -= 1               
            else:
                res[k] = nums[l] * nums[l]
                l += 1
            k -= 1
        return res
```
